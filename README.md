# Iota Powered Plants
Welcome to my Hackathon entry for the [iot2tangle hackathon](https://hackathon.iot2tangle.io/)!

This repository consists of a few different code projects that make up the entirety of my entry.

# Sensor data
For my IoT datapoints I've tweaked the XDK110 to work with analog sensors through the Extension Hub. Read more about it, see a picture of the setup or try to check it out yourself and start sending extra datapoints to the Tangle!
